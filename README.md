# TopPop
TopPop is my most recent project and its still in its infancy. The goal of TopPop is to accumulate up-to-date information on music artists and present them in user friendly manner. Currently TopPop can uses several API's such as Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Spotify etc to present the most recent data on your favorite artists. Some of the data retrieved will then be analyzed through a form of AI called Natural Language Processing to determine the publics sentiment on that artists. All the data on TopPop is dynamically generated and grows the more people use it. It is built with the current technologies in MEAN stack, allowing me to write both the server and client side in JavaScript. TopPop when completed could be invaluable for companies who are looking for the most popular Artists to market their products.
